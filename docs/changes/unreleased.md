The short list is in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).

## Fixed

### Japanese wording on the web page

A new check reads the Japanese in `web/` (the strings of `web/*.ts` and the text of `web/index.html`) against [docs/japanese-style.md](../japanese-style.md), as it already read `src/`. It found one string: the settings dialog's explanation of "Clear stored data" said 消します; it says 削除します now.
